            <h2>Efficiency or Deception? AI as a Trick of the Trade</h2>
            <p class="date">February 18, 2026</p>

            <p>In the modern workplace, the definition of "working hard" is shifting. As we integrate generative AI into our daily workflows, a controversial question arises: Is using AI to complete tasks faster a "cheat" to your employer? While some might argue it devalues the effort an employer pays for, I believe it is more accurately described as mastering the new "tricks of the trade."</p>

            <p>Historically, every industry has adopted tools to increase output. A carpenter using a nail gun isn't "cheating" compared to one using a hammer; they are simply being more efficient. In my own research into financial markets and sports betting, I’ve found that high-level traders use algorithms to process data that no human could handle manually. This isn't viewed as a shortcut, but as a technical necessity to stay competitive.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things." — Peter Drucker
            </blockquote>

            <p>If an employee uses AI to draft a report in twenty minutes that used to take two hours, and the quality remains high, the employer isn't being "cheated." In fact, the employer is benefiting from a more agile worker who can now pivot to higher-level strategic thinking. However, this relies on the user being the "pilot" of the AI, ensuring the output is accurate and ethical.</p>

            <p>This conversation is happening all across our class network. For instance, in a recent post on the <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/engl170-spring2026-dashboard/">ENGL 170 Dashboard</a>, my classmates and I have been debating how these tools redefine intellectual labor. Much like the discussions on the <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/plate-composition-blog/">instructor's blog</a>, the focus shouldn't be on the time spent, but on the value created.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, AI is a tool of leverage. Learning how to prompt effectively and integrate AI into a professional workflow is a skill in itself. It’s not about doing less work; it’s about doing more significant work in the same amount of time.</p>

                    <p><em>Annotation:</em> This source from our course instructor provides the foundational framework for how we view composition and labor in the age of AI. I used this blog to ground my argument that the value of work should be measured by the final "composition" and its impact rather than the manual hours logged. It helps illustrate that using AI is a contemporary evolution of the writing process rather than an avoidance of it.</p>

                    <p><em>Annotation:</em> Drucker’s work on knowledge worker productivity is essential for distinguishing between efficiency and effectiveness. I applied his philosophy to the AI debate to show that if AI helps an employee "do the right things" faster, they are fulfilling their primary duty to their employer. This external source supports my "tricks of the trade" stance by showing that professional mastery has always been about optimizing output.</p>
