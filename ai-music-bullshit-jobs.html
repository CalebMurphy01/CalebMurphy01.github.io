            <h2>The AI Jukebox: Creative Evolution or Just More Bullshit Jobs?</h2>
            <p class="date">February 25, 2026</p>

            <p>A recent deep dive by the <strong>New York Times</strong> has shed light on a bizarre new frontier in the creator economy: people are making a "stupid" amount of money using generative AI to flood streaming platforms with music. Tools like Suno and Udio have allowed users to churn out thousands of tracks, capturing royalties and gaming the algorithms of Spotify and Apple Music. While some see this as the democratization of creativity, it raises a much darker question about the nature of work in the 21st century.</p>

            <p>This trend connects directly to the ideas I explored in my previous post on <a href="graeber-bullshit-jobs.html">David Graeber’s "Bullshit Jobs"</a>. Graeber argued that our society is riddled with roles that are completely pointless—work that doesn't need to exist but persists to keep the gears of bureaucracy turning. If we look at the rise of AI music through this lens, we aren't seeing a creative revolution; we are seeing the workforce evolve into a new category of "Taskmasters" and "Box Tickers."</p>

            <p>In my analysis of <a href="the-shackles-of-busywork.html">Graeber’s taxonomy of labor</a>, I questioned if AI would liberate us from drudgery or simply automate the "bullshit." The New York Times report suggests the latter. Instead of a musician spending years mastering the craft of composition—a process that requires genuine human struggle—we now have "prompt engineers" spending hours clicking buttons to generate "content" that no one actually asked for, simply to capture a fraction of a cent from a streaming play.</p>

            <p>This is the slow evolution of the workforce: jobs are being replaced by AI not because the AI is "better" at the art, but because the AI is better at performing the administrative busywork of the digital age. We are witnessing the birth of the "Duct Taper" job for the digital era—people whose only role is to patch together AI outputs to satisfy a machine-driven market. If a "bullshit job" is one that the worker knows is useless, what do we call a career spent managing an algorithm that mimics human soulfulness for the sake of a payout?</p>

            <p>As we continue to track these changes on the <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/engl170-spring2026-dashboard/">ENGL 170 Dashboard</a>, it’s clear that the line between meaningful labor and automated noise is thinning. We aren't just losing jobs; we're losing the human purpose that makes work worth doing in the first place.</p>
