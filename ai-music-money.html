            <h2>The AI Jukebox: Creative Evolution or Just More Bullshit Jobs?</h2>
            <p class="date">February 26, 2026</p>

            <p>Recent reports, including deep dives by outlets like the <strong>New York Times</strong>, have highlighted a wild new trend in the creator economy: regular people are making a "stupid" amount of money using generative AI to create music. Startups like Suno and Udio have flooded streaming platforms with millions of AI-generated tracks, some of which are racking up millions of streams and generating significant royalties for their "creators."</p>

            <p>On the surface, this looks like a gold rush. However, as I’ve discussed in my previous posts about <a href="https://calebmurphy01.github.io/the-crisis-of-meaning-david-graebers-bullshit-jobs.html">David Graeber’s "Bullshit Jobs" theory</a>, we have to ask ourselves: is this actual work, or are we just watching the birth of a new category of "Taskmasters" and "Box Tickers"?</p>

            <blockquote>
                "The economy of AI music is built totally on the intellectual property, globally, of musicians everywhere... our property has been consumed in order to replace us." — Tift Merritt, Artists Rights Alliance.
            </blockquote>

            <p>In my reflection on <a href="https://calebmurphy01.github.io/the-shackles-of-busywork-graebers-taxonomy-of-labor.html">Graeber’s taxonomy of labor</a>, I questioned whether AI would eliminate meaningless work or simply create new forms of it. The rise of "AI slop" in the music industry suggests the latter. Instead of people spending years mastering an instrument—a process Suno CEO Mikey Shulman infamously called "not really enjoyable"—they are now performing the "bullshit" task of prompt engineering to trigger an algorithm.</p>

            <p>This evolution of the workforce is concerning. We are moving toward a reality where "jobs" consist of managing machines that mimic human soulfulness. If a "bullshit job" is one that is so completely pointless that even the person doing it cannot justify its existence, what does that say about a professional "AI Musician" who doesn't know a C-major from a G-chord? We are trading human craft for automated volume, and calling the resulting profit "success."</p>

            <p>As the industry negotiates with these AI giants, we must decide if we want a future filled with meaningful human labor or one where we are all just "Duct Tapers" for the algorithms.
