            <h2>Prediction Markets: A New Way to See Reality</h2>
            <p class="date">January 22, 2026</p>

            <p>Prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket are more than just gambling hubs; they are real-time data engines. By putting a price on the future, these platforms strip away the "noise" of traditional media and political bias.</p>

            <p>When someone bets their own money on an outcome, they are forced to be honest. This creates a "truth machine" that often predicts events—from interest rate hikes to election results—more accurately than expert pundits or traditional polling. In this blog, I'll be exploring how we can use these metrics to better understand the world around us.</p>
