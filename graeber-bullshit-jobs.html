            <h2>The Crisis of Meaning: David Graeber and the "Bullshit Job"</h2>
            <p class="date">February 22, 2026</p>

            <p>In his provocative research and famous talk, anthropologist David Graeber introduced a concept that has resonated deeply with modern workers: the "bullshit job." Graeber defines these as forms of paid employment that are so completely pointless or unnecessary that even the employee cannot justify their existence. This phenomenon creates what he termed "spiritual violence," where individuals are forced to spend their lives performing tasks they know achieve nothing.</p>

            <p>While discussing the evolution of modern labor, I found a compelling connection to a post on the <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/engl170-spring2026-dashboard/">course dashboard</a>. Many of us are exploring how AI and automation might finally address the 15-hour workweek that Graeber often referenced, yet his research suggests that instead of leisure, our society often invents more "box-ticking" roles to maintain the status quo of full-time employment.</p>

            <p>Graeber’s taxonomy of these roles—ranging from "flunkies" to "taskmasters"—challenges us to rethink the value we place on work for the sake of work. As we navigate a semester focused on AI and intellectual work, understanding the distinction between meaningful contribution and mere activity is more vital than ever.</p>

                    <br>In this foundational text, Graeber expands his original essay into a full theory, categorizing meaningless work into five distinct types. This is the primary source for understanding the psychological and social impact of the "bullshit job" phenomenon.

                    <br>The original viral essay that started the conversation. It asks why the automation-driven leisure time predicted in the 20th century never arrived, proposing instead that we created useless jobs to keep people busy.
