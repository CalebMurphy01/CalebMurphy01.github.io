<h2>Rethinking the Dashboard: Beyond Markets and Metrics</h2>
<p class="date">February 2, 2026</p>

<p>In his recent post, <a href="https://calebmurphy01.github.io/markets-and-metrics.html">Caleb Murphy explored the initial feelings of being tracked by our course scraper</a>. This feeling of being "watched" by a dashboard is a micro-reflection of a much larger trend in higher education. The infiltration of neoliberal ideology has introduced "markets and metrics" into every sphere of our academic lives. While the dashboard helps us see our collective output, it also risks reducing our intellectual work to a simple count of posts and words.</p>

<p>The danger of this metric-centric approach is that it can "narrow the curriculum" to emphasize development of discrete, specialized skills rather than a broader, deeper learning experience. As we use AI to help us write and research, we must be careful not to value only efficiency. As Vijay Eswaran points out, "Technology without humanity is acceleration without direction". We must ensure that our use of these tools is guided by intention and principle.</p>

<p>Instead of just checking boxes to satisfy a scraper, we should view our blogs as part of a "commons"—a shared space that we steward together. This means engaging with each other's ideas in a way that creates "authentic intelligence," rooted in the wisdom that comes from empathy and ethics. Our "Growth Quotient" should be measured by how much our writing uplifts the people in our course network, not just by how many times we appear at the top of the dashboard list.</p>

<blockquote>
"The real question is not how intelligent our machines become, but how conscious we remain as humans." 
</blockquote>

<p>As we move forward in the semester, let us use these technical tools—the scrapers, the HTML templates, and the AI assistants—as thinking partners. By doing so, we can transform a system of surveillance into a system of collaborative learning that values the human dimension of growth beyond the numbers.</p>
